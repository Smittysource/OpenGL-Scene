# CS330

Working on this project has been very challenging. I never worked with OpenGL before, so this experience was all new to me.

Throughout the time working on this project, I have learned a lot not just about OpenGL but also about iterating through design cycles and making changes as better ways to do things are found. Building parts of the application and then realizing how they can be put together or modularized helped to separate out different tasks into classes and methods. There were a lot of iterations involved in laying out objects in the 3D space and combining different shapes to create whole objects.

Each milestone step building up to the project was designed to be used in the completed application. Instead of waiting until the end to try to put things together, I compiled what was available each iteration into a more complete representation of the original scene. There were several times where I had to seek external resources to decide how I would go about building different shapes.

By learning about computer graphics, I have a much deeper understanding of some of the mathematical concepts that I have learned in college. Having a use for these concepts make them much more interesting to me and will help me enjoy working with them. I feel confident that I will be able to use these skills in the future as I work toward my educational and professional goals.
